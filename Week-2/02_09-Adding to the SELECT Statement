## SELECT TOP n records

The `TOP` instruction is one of many instructions that can be added to the `SELECT` statement when making queries. It is especially helpful during the initial exploration of a database when trying to build an understanding of the structure and content.

Using `TOP` will return only the number of records you specify. For example, `SELECT TOP 100 * FROM raw_players` will return the first 100 records from the raw_players table. Any number can be used to determine how many records will be returned, but keep in mind the larger the number, the more data will be processed, and the longer it will take for your results to come back.

Additionally, when using TOP, if the number of records requested is more than the number of records available, then all records will be returned.
