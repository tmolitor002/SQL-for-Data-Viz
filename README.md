# SQL for Data Viz

This course was created for users of various data visualization tools such as Tableau and Power BI to learn how to use SQL. By no means will it teach you everything you need to know, but it should give you a strong foundation to start employing SQL in a professional environment.

The best way to learn about the course is to jump right in. The content and learning objectives build on each other, so if you're new, it's best to go in order. While the content is separated by weeks, feel free to go faster or slower if that is what is right for you.
